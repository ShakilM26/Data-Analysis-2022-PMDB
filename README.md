# PMDB 2022 (Personal movie database)
* I created this dataset myself. 
* Here's the movie data I watched in 2022.


## Key responsibilities
1. Collect the data from different source.
2. Identify the missing values, outliers and anomalies.
3. Perform analyzing, summarizing (mean,median,mode), finding pattern, visualize correlation and relationships.


## What I found
* It was basically a fun and practice project for me.
* Collecting data, storing it, analyzing it later, figuring out what genre of movies I've watched more, whether I'm interested in comicbooks, etc.
